      I’m a multidisciplinary artist from the San Francisco Bay Area.
      My specialization is storyboarding for television and feature film, but I can illustrate, design, code, animate and direct, too.
    <p>
      I also write and edit for a handful of independent publications. Currently, I’m the Editor-in-Chief for
      <a href="http://sunstrokemagazine.com/">Sunstroke Magazine</a>,
      a print zine and interdisciplinary arts collective that centers Generation Z, culture and activism.
      This Spring, I will be an editorial intern at <a href="https://www.npr.org/music/">NPR Music</a>.
