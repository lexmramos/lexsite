      My name is <b>Alex</b>. I’m a multidisciplinary artist and writer from the San Francisco Bay Area.
      My specialization is storyboarding for TV and film, and crafting music criticism,
      but I can illustrate, design, code, animate, produce and direct, too.
    <p>
      I’m currently at <a href="https://www.npr.org/music/">NPR Music</a> as an editorial intern.
      I’m also the Editor-in-Chief for <a href="http://sunstrokemagazine.com/">Sunstroke Magazine</a>,
      a print zine and interdisciplinary arts collective that centers Generation Z, culture and activism.
