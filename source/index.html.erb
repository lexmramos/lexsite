      Hi, I’m <b>Alex Ramos</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m an artist, writer and editor from the San Francisco Bay Area.
      My specialization is writing music criticism and making art for animation,
      but I can storyboard, illustrate, design, code, animate, produce and direct, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m currently at <a href="https://www.npr.org/music/">NPR Music</a> as an editorial intern.
      I’m also the Editor-in-Chief for <a href="http://sunstrokemagazine.com/">Sunstroke Magazine</a>,
      a print zine and interdisciplinary arts collective that centers Generation Z, culture and activism.
    </p>
