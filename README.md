Hi, this is Alex's personal websiteâ€”built by me, for me.

I'm using Ruby v2.6.4. Once you've got the project downloaded or pulled:

Run ```bundle install```, and then run ```middleman server```.

After that, you should be able to view it on localhost:4567 in your browser.

As always, thanks to Walker for design feedback and helping me tidy up.
